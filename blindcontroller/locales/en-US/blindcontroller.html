    <p>This node controls roller blind height based on the position of the sun in the sky.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mode</b>: the mode of control of the blind</li>
        <li><b>Orientation</b>: the perpendicular bearing of the window</li>
        <li><b>Negative Offset</b>: anti-clockwise offset from orientation for determination of whether the sun is coming through window</li>
        <li><b>Positive Offset</b>: clockwise offset from orientation for determination of whether the sun is coming through window</li>
        <li><b>Top</b>: the top of the window (in centimetres) from floor level</li>
        <li><b>Bottom</b>: the bottom of the window (in centimetres) from floor level</li>
        <li><b>Depth</b>: how far into the room (in centimetres), the direct sunlight is to be allowed</li>
        <li><b>Altitude Threshold</b>: minimum altitude of the sun for determination of blind position</li>
        <li><b>Increment</b>: increment in which the blind height can be controlled</li>
        <li><b>Max Open Position</b>: the maximum the blind can be opened during daylight hours</li>
        <li><b>Max Closed Position</b>: the maximum the blind can be closed during daylight hours</li>
        <li><b>Temperature Threshold</b>: temperature at which the blind will be fully closed while the sun is in the window.  This setting overrides <b>altitudethreshold</b> and <b>depth</b> in the calculation</li>
        <li><b>Clouds Threshold</b>: A numerical value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the percentage of sky occluded by clouds. A value of 0 corresponds to clear sky, 0.4 to scattered clouds, 0.75 to broken cloud cover, and 1 to completely overcast skies.</li>
        <li><b>Night Position</b>: The position of the blind outside of daylight hours.</li>
        <li><b>Expiry Period</b>: The time in hours a manual setting will remain in place.</li>
